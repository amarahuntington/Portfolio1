~~I'm currently in my fourth year~~ 

Majoring in: 
**_Neuroscience_** 

Reason for Enrollment in Neural Data Science
**To fulfill the lab requirement for my degree program. I also hope to expand my skill set in this unfamiliar field in order to become a well rounded student.** 

### Interest in Neuroscience 

>I became interested in Neuroscience because I love to learn about the complexities of life. I remember being mind-blown once I had learned about cells as a child, as it shifted my entire perspective of existence. Neuroscience is an amazing field because it goes in depth into these intricacies of life but it also explores broader topics in psychology and sociology. 

### Future Plans 

I currently do not have a set career path that I've decided upon. After graduation I plan to travel in hopes to learn about the various options that are available to me.
